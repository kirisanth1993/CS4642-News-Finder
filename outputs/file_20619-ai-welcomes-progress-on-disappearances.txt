According to surviving family members, more than 100 cadres of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who surrendered at the end of the war in May 2009, have subsequently disappeared. In August 2013, 13 of those families filed habeas corpus applications in the courts of Sri Lanka, seeking information about their whereabouts.\n", "nextContent": "", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab The overall poverty level in Sri Lanka has decline"}
