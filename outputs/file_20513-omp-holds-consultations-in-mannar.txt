Earlier, member of the OMP, Dr Nimalka Fernando was quoted assuring the families that their problems will be addressed and asking the families to place their trust in the newly formed office.\nHowever, according to regional correspondents attending the meeting, the public had raised their concerns, claiming they were finding it difficult to have faith in the office after the long period they have had to go through without receiving any answers about their missing family members. As a result, many are said to have requested an international mechanism to be put in place.\nMeanwhile, Peiris also said much still needs to be done with the setting of the OMP such as hiring necessary staff. \u201cIt will happen simultaneously along with the public process,\u201d he said, adding that, however, a time frame cannot be given as it is an ongoing and complex process.\nThe series of regional level consultations are considered a vital and the initial step in the process to operationalise the functions of the OMP to assist the families of missing persons. Commencing in Mannar, the OMP will visit Matara, Trincomalee, Mullaitivu, Kandy, Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Batticaloa and Ampara in the first phase.\nThe office while understanding the urgency and frustrations of the families has requested them to be patient so that the office can ensure the vital processes put in place.\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Statement on the Inter-Korea Summit on 27 April 2018"}
