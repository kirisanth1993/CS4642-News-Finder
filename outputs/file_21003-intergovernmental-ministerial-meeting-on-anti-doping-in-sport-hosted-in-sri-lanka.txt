This legislation, enacted at a plenary session of the House of Councilors of Japan, establishes a legal framework for anti-doping measures \u2013 something which Tokyo 2020 President Yoshir\u014d Mori says has been \u201ccalled for globally, and will boost anti-doping activities in Japan\u201d.\nIt will also make it possible for the Japan Anti-Doping Agency, the Japan Sports Council and public authorities to share information and implement anti-doping measures more effectively. The passing of the law came less than a month after two-time backstroke swimming world champion Junya Koga was removed from the Japanese squad for the Asian Games after failing a drugs test. The failure marked another blemish on Japan\u2019s previously good anti-doping record in the build-up to Tokyo 2020.\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Global civil society organizations and SL think-Tank host events on conflict prevention"}
