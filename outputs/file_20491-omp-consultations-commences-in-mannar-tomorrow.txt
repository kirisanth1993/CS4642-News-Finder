In the coming weeks, the OMP will visit Matara, Trincomalee, Mulaitivu, Kandy, Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Batticaloa and Ampara in a first phase of visits. The purpose of these meetings will be to share the OMP\u2019s organisational plan and strategies, as they currently stand, in order to hear public views and incorporate suggestions on measures and processes. The plans thus far attempt to build on the lessons learned and recommendations from previous commissions and the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms process.\nThe OMP understands the urgency and frustration of the families and individuals who have been searching for their loved ones over a number of years, but respectfully requests their patience to ensure vital processes are put in place in order to ensure an effective response and to avoid\nmeasures. These consultations mark the start of the outreach process of the OMP and are a positive indication that the search for missing and disappeared persons is underway\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Afternoon thundershowers to continue..."}
