However, when toughened sanctions were imposed on Tehran in 2012 to curb its nuclear ambitions, state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) was forced to look for other light crudes.\nThe existing refinery accounts for 30 per cent of Sri Lanka\u2019s fuel requirement, but the head of CPC last week said that upgrading \u201cmay not be the solution\u201d because Sri Lanka needs a refinery capable of handling all types of crude.\nIran\u2019s offer comes as Chinese, Middle East and Russian companies are in \u201cpreliminary discussions\u201d to build a 100,000 bpd refinery for CPC.Two Chinese companies have jointly bid for a 100,000 bpd refinery, with annual output of about 5 million tonnes a year, in the southern town of Hambantota, where China controls a sea port and plans an industrial zone.\nSri Lanka is still in talks about the Hambantota refinery, though the government has blocked a proposal by the Chinese companies to sell fuel locally.Sri Lanka has also discussed another 100,000 bpd refinery in partnership with Indian Oil Corp, but there has been no progress on that plan.\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab High Commission in London holds Annual Pirith Chanting Ceremony"}
