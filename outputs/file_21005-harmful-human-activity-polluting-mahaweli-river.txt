Undegradable waste including polythene plastics and parts of electronic equipment discarded in the catchment areas of the hill country were daily getting washed away into the river due to heavy rains experienced in the region in addition to the residues of chemicals such as pesticides and weedicides applied into the plantations,\u201d she added.\n\u201cAlthough waste management schemes are being implemented in Urban areas, the lack of such waste management schemes in the rural sector too had greatly contributed to this unhealthy development,\u201d she said.\nDr. (Mrs) Dissanayake said the responsibility of protecting this important water body from further pollution devolved in both authorities and the general public.\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Showers, thundershowers expected today"}
