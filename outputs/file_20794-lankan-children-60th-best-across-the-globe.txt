However, still more than 17 percent of Sri Lankan children under five suffer from stunting, according to the report, while almost one percent of babies born die before their fifth birthday.\nSri Lanka improved one place to 60 in the report\u2019s \u2018End of Childhood\u2019 index, which ranks countries according to where childhood is most and least threatened.
