They did not want to be hoodwinked by these mechanisms any longer, the demonstrators holding placards cried.\nThe OMP Commissioners who stopped to talk with the protesting families before walking into the Divisional Secretariat for their meetings, promised to come back out and hold discussions with demonstrators too.\nFollowing the meetings inside the Secretariat which were attended by about 60 families of the missing from Mullativu, the Commissioners went outside to speak with the protesting families for about an hour. The demonstrators were from both Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi. \u201cThe OMP met the families of the disappeared at Mullaitivu and engaged for one hour with protesting families who were boycotting the event,\u201d OMP Chairman Saliya Pieris said on his official Twitter account after the meetings.\nThe Commissioners also held a press briefing, explaining the purposes of their visit, prior to leaving Mullaitivu. The Commissioners said they had travelled to the formerly embattled region to get input from civil society groups and families of the disappeared themselves, about how the mechanism should operate in order to launch investigations into the thousands of cases of enforced disappearances during the war and two youth insurrections in the country.\nSeveral families raised concerns with the OMP about the list of surrendees at the end of the war, which the Government earlier promised to obtain from the security establishment, one OMP commissioner told the Sunday Observer.The OMP Commissioners\u2019 meetings were split into two two-hour sessions, with one held at 9 a.m. and the other at 11a.m. at the Mullaitivu Divisional Secretariat.\nFamilies from Thunukkai, Manthai East, Weli Oya, Oddusuddan, Puthukuduirippu and Maritime Pattu met with the OMP Commissioners yesterday, Pieris said. All seven Commissioners of the Office of Missing Persons participated in the consultations in Mullaitivu.\n", "externalNewsLink": "back to top"}
