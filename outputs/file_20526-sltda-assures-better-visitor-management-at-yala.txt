We also need to ensure better discipline on the part of Safari operators visiting the Yala national park on a daily basis. Only a handful of unruly operators is enough to cause great damage to the environment and to the animals inhabiting the park,\u201d he said, addressing the meeting held at Cinnamon Wild, Yala, on Saturday (05).\nThe meeting was attended by all major hotel operators in the Yala-Palatupana area, industry stakeholders and representatives from all government bodies responsible the protection and development of the Yala national park. Senior officials from the SLTDA, including its Director General Upali Ratnayake, also attended the meeting. Ratnayaka also requested all hoteliers in the area to only work with disciplined and scrupulous Safari operators who do not conduct their business at the expense of the environment and wild animals.\n\u201cWe do not undermine the value of Safari operators in the area as they are an important cog in the wheel. But a group of unruly and unscrupulous Safari operators can damage the sustainability of the wildlife experience the Yala national park offers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe may also have to revisit the road plan near the Yala buffer zone to facilitate the natural movements of wild animals. Some roads, which we recently opened up for construction purposes, will have to be closed down as they restrict the usual \u2018crossings\u2019 of wild animals,\u201d Ratnyaka added. The SLTDA Chairman also discussed the tourism development masterplan for the Yala-Palatupana area.\nAs part of the engagement with industry stakeholders in the area, Ratnayaka and other senior officials representing the SLTDA inspected the constructions done by private parties near the Yala buffer zone to make sure the right standards are met from a tourism standpoint. They also inspected hotels and properties located at SLTDA lands in the area which have been leased out to private parties.\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab New Immigration and Emigration Act to be   Formulate"}
