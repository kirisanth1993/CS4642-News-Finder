The commissioners said they were concerned that \u201ca chilling effect\u201d would be created by this general prohibition. Such a blanket exemption is \u201ccontrary to the letter and spirit of the RTI Act,\u201d they said.\nIn an interview, Transparency International RTI Manager Sankhitha Gunaratne said that the highlighted clauses in the National Audit Bill, as well as information exemptions in the Office of Missing Persons Act, amounted to Parliament \u201cchipping away\u201d at the framework set up under the country\u2019s Right to Information Law. She added that the draft Reparations Bill, accessed through an RTI request, contains a similar exemption. The Supreme Court, in its response to Transparency International, said it did not find the proposed exemptions in the National Audit Bill unconstitutional.\n\u201cAs the Bill now moves through Parliament, the RTI Commission warned that \u201cthe precedent set by shielding some offices and individuals from RTI in this manner will dilute the victories gained for Sri Lankans through the enactment of the globally recognized law.\u201d\n\u201cThe exemptions would also \u201cdiscourage largely positive tendencies evidenced so far by Public Authorities in dismantling a decades-old culture of secrecy and denial of legitimate information,\u201d they added.\n", "externalNewsLink": "back to top"}
