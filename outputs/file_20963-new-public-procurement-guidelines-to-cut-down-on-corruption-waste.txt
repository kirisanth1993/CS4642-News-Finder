The NPC stated that it needs to be approved in Parliament before August 9.\nThe NPC was one of the independent commissions set up by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution and is empowered to formulate a \u2018fair, equitable transparent, competitive and cost effective procurement guidelines and procedure for procurement\u2019 and to \u2018monitor and report to appropriate authorities when the procurement process has not been followed in an appropriate manner.\n\u201cThe NPC only has the power to monitor, we do not have the authority to stop any irregular procurements,\u201d NPC Chairman Nihal Wickramasuriya siad. The Chairman addressing the media at BMIC explained that once the guidelines and handbook for government servants are approved, all ministries would have to formulate their own procurement plans in accordance with approved action plans.\nThe NPC would then monitor whether the ministries and departments are conducting procurements according to the plans, whether all qualified bidders are afforded equal opportunity in the bidding process, whether the selection of contractors and the awarding of contracts are done in a fair and transparent manner, whether suitably qualified members are appointed for Procurement Committees and Technical Evaluation Committees and to investigate and report on officers who have worked outside of the guidelines.\nThe NPC has the power to report institutions which do not follow the Guideline to Parliament and the Auditor General. Wickramasuriya also explained that they had taken the opportunity to introduce new features such as the ability to conduct procurement with multiple suppliers at once on a short to medium term basis, to move towards E-procurement, Information Systems, Open Contracting Data Standards (OCDS), Green Procurement and the introduction of Appeal Boards to all levels of procurements, \u201cAt present, only Cabinet level procurements have Appeal Boards but now we will have it at all levels of government,\u201d the NPC Chairman said.\nAccording to NPC Member P.A.D.C.B. Perera, however moving completely to an E-procurement level would take the country at least 10 years, \u201cBut, we can start small, like publishing tenders and tender procedures online\u201d. The OCDS system which will allow the public to access procurement data in the meantime will also only come into effect after the E-procurement process in complete, added Perera, \u201cWe have set the policy so we are ready when the time comes\u201d.\nThe Treasury which is handling the implementation of the Guidelines, he said has already appointed a Steering Committee and studying the best way forward.The Guidelines in addition will also empower the NPC to look into the credibility of persons appointed to Appeal Boards.More importantly this will also allow citizens to submit Right to Information Requests once tenders are awarded and they will have access to the full reports of the Technical Evaluation Committees, \u201cThe public will know how their money is spent,\u201d Wickramasuriya said.\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Gnanasara Thero sentenced to 6 months RI"}
