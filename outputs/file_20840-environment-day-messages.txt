Careful consumption of natural resources, proper dumping of waste, tree plantation and environmentally friendly gardening, and polythene and plastic reuse are just some of the measures that we can take in our day to day lives, to protect the environment.\nThe theme for 2018 is beating plastic pollution. In Sri Lanka we announced a ban on polythene that took effect from 1st of September 2017 in a bid to find a sustainable solution to solid waste management. Furthermore, we need to introduce and promote biologically degradable polythene and plastic, at the same time as encouraging small and medium scale entrepreneurs to producing more environmentally friendly alternatives to polythene.\nAs humans, we are bound to protect our environment. We are a product of our environment and the demise of the environment would be commensurate with our own demise. Therefore, on World Environment Day we shall commit ourselves to the protection of our ubiquitous partner, the environment.\nPrime Minister\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab President calls for the environmental conservation with a continuous programme"}
