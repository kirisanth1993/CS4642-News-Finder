It will further be increased up to 6% in the next few years.\u00a0 The allocation for health will be increased up to 3.5% of GDP in the next few years. The allocations for public welfare have been increased to 265 billion rupees in 2017 from 165 billion rupees in 2014. It is an increase from 1.6% to 2% of GDP.\n16. The economy during the previous government, handled by their cronies and henchmen didn\u2019t have any proper system in place to implement the economic development in a manner that would bring direct benefits to the people. The Rajapaksa sibblings who ruled this country under such a background have been attempting to regain power\u00a0 by throwing the people into \u201cVipath Maga\u201d the destructive path. Therefore we urge the people to defeat such attempts and rally round the Government\u2019s agenda to build a strong economy and a rich country by the year 2\n", "externalNewsLink": "back to top"}
