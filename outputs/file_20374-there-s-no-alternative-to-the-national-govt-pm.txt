Developing industries and generating employment is time consuming. President Premadasa wanted me to take over the Ministry of Industries. He had a discussion with me on these matters. We provided tax incentives to industrialists. Later he wanted more employment opportunities in rural areas. He came up with the 100 garment factory concept. I asked him how it could be implemented because rural areas do not have infrastructure facilities. But he went ahead with his concept and implemented it within one month. Later he extended it but was unable to complete it because of his assassination.\"\nOpposition Leader R. Sampanthan said former President Premadasa was deeply committed to bringing about peace and harmony among peoples of all communities. \"He wanted all Sri Lankans to live in an undivided, indivisible nation. President Premadasa felt that the 13th Amendment is not the final solution to the national question. This why the Mangala Moonasinghe committee was appointed,\" he said.\nSpeaker Karu Jayasuriya said former President Premsdasa did not consider political differences as a barrier when implementing social welfare programmes.\n-\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Late President Premadasa's 25th Death Anniversary"}
