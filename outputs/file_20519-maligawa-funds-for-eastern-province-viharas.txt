The ceremony held at Gomankadawala, in Trincomalee at the Ranpokunugama Raja Maha Viharaya was attended by the Malwatte Anunayake Thera Ven. Simbulkumgure Sri Wimaldharama Thera, Asgiriya Anunayake Thera Panditha Wenduruwawe Sri Upali Thera and other monks and officials from the two Maha Viharas.\nAddressing a gathering at the ceremony, the Diyawadane Nilame said he could have banked this money and earned interest for the Sri Dalada Maligawa but with the concurrence of the two Mahanayke\u2019s of Malwatte and Asgiri Chapters he decided that the money should be utilised to rehabilitate these places of religious worship in the East. He said through this programme the Maha Sangha of the area could look into both the spiritual and mental well being of the people.\nThe Diyawadana Nilame said following a survey by Maligawa officials who had earmarked 144 Viharas, it was decided that 125 needed immediate attention. He said the programme will be coordinated by the Sasana Arakshaka Mandalaya along with Trincomalee\u2019s Divisional Secretary P.R.Jayaratne.\nHe said this was just the beginning of a much larger programme aimed at rehabilitating all the Viharas that were battered during the 30-year-old conflict. He said the initial survey was begun in 2006.\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Weather today"}
