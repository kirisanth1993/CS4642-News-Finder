It also demonstrates the EU's commitment to support the Government of Sri Lanka's reform and reconciliation agenda.\nProgress has been made by the Government of Sri Lanka in protecting and enhancing human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country, the EU said in a statement. \"A number of important measures have been taken, including the operationalization of the Office on Missing Persons, the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the passing of the Right to Information Bill. The EU drew attention to the importance of Sri Lanka making prompt and concrete progress in fulfilling international commitments on human rights and labor rights as well as environmental protection.\"\nThere was a detailed exchange of information on many important ongoing reforms, such as the replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to bring them in line with international standards, and the status of the Constitution. The participants agreed on the need to make further progress on reconciliation. To this end, the full implementation of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution of October 2015, including the urgent return of land, remains a priority. The EU reiterated its readiness to continue supporting the Government in advancing national reconciliation.\nThere were also discussions on the progress made and the challenges ahead in maintaining the freedoms of expression and of the media, strengthening the civil society, advancing the rights of women and children, respecting non-discrimination on any grounds, addressing the rights of minorities, accelerating the return of land, labor rights, and implementing the treaty obligations and the rule of law.\nThe EU encouraged Sri Lanka to address issues relating to religious and ethnic hatred and to maintain zero tolerance for hate speech and crimes. The EU stressed the importance of addressing areas of concern, especially torture, violence against women and the need to combat corruption.\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Sri Lanka jumping 13 notches becomes ranking 67th in 2018 Global Peace Index"}
