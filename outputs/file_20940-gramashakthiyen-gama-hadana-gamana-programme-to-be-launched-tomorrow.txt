This project stands out different from the other projects that were launched so far to eradicate poverty since it is a project that drives people to stand up on their own feet.\n", "nextContent": "Thus, most projects were launched to eradicate poverty as a deal between the people and the government. But the Grama Shakthi People\u2019s Movement has systematically adapted the contribution of the private sector in order to\u00a0 \u00a0make a successful project which empowers people and eradicates poverty. It is done in order to create a better market and to ensure a fair price for the goods for the products of the people.\nThus the Grama Shakthi People\u2019s Movement guides small entrepreneurs to make their businesses a success competing with huge organizations. Providing them new technological knowledge, linking them with the local and the international market, providing loans and funds, are accomplished under this project. Through that their lives are uplifted while the productions will draw foreign exchange to the country.\nIn order to accomplish such objectives a memorandum of understanding should be signed between the organizations which are popular nationally and internationally.\nThe North Western Province Action Committee is to be held tomorrow while the district secretaries of Kurunegala and Puttalama will be offered the first installments of funds that are offered to the Gramashakthi people\u2019s movement committees, by the President.\nTwo production villages that are operated under Grama Shakthi People\u2019s Movement will be observed by the President tomorrow when he visits Mohottuwarama and Thalawila production villages.\nSource: PMD\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Last respects to veteran author and scriptwriter"}
