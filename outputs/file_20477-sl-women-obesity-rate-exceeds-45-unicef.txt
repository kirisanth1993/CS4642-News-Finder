Underlying causes include the under-investment in maternal health services,the low prioritization of nutrition services,and the low reach of care for pregnant women,\u201d the UNICEF said.\n\u201cPregnant and breastfeeding women need better nutrition to protect children from stunting and disease. The progress on improving nutritional care of women in South Asia during and after pregnancy is slow, impacting on their children\u2019s survival, growth and development,\u201d he said.\nIt said over one-third of the world\u2019s anaemic women live in South Asia, and no country was on track to meet the global nutrition target to reduce anaemia by 50 per cent women by 2025. In Sri Lanka, nearly 32 per cent of pregnant women are anaemic.\n\u201cChildren who are born small due to poor maternal nutrition start life at a huge disadvantage. They are more likely to become wasted or stunted in early life, do less well at school, earn lower wages in adulthood and suffer diabetes and chronic heart diseases later in life,\u201d it said.\nSAARC Secretary General saidAmjad Hussain Sial said women's nutrition required special attention and the governments should look at how they could provide healthy diet and lifestyle options. \u201cWe must strive towards a collective effort that involves health providers, community based workers, families, schools and mothers themselves,\u201d he said.\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Afternoon thundershowers still high over the island."}
