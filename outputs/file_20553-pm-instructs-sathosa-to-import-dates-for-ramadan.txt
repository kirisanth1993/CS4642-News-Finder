Fowzie.\n", "nextContent": "Dates are distributed to Muslims during Ramdan through Mosques. This year, steps had been taken to distribute 150 metric tonnes of dates donated by Saudi Arabia. In addition, Sathosa too had been requested to import another 150 metric tonnes of dates to be distributed among the public.\nThe request was made due to the decline in date supplies from the Middle East as their harvests had been dwindling as of recent times. Further, private retailers such as Cargills too, had been requested the same by the Prime Minister.\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Western province won marathon at National Sports Festival"}
