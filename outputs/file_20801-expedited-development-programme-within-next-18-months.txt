We have now been able to stabilize the economy. In the next 18 months left for this Government, we have decided to concentrate on village-level development through Grama Niladari Officers and Divisional Secretaries,\u201d the Prime Minister said.\nHe said he advised all ministers to identify priority development projects and fully focus on them until the end of 2019. \u201cThat is what people expected from us. They voted us for that. Re-building a country is not an easy task. That is why we decided to launched this expedited programme,\u201d he added.\nThe PM said that he had instructed the ministers to concentrate on the development work without getting involved in all issues coming their way. \u201cWe have issues. We are trying to resolve them. It is normal to have problems in politics,\u201d he said.\nThe Premier said construction and renovation of road network, repairing small irrigational tanks under the \u201cGamperaliya\u201d project, increasing loan facilities for self employment, tourism sector development and facilitating training and job opportunities at private institutions are being focused under the expedited development plan.\nHe pointed out that eventhough the Government had plans to carry out these development activities in 2017, unexpected disasters such as floods, drought and the collapse of Meethotamulla garbage mound deferred the Government\u2019s plans.\nHe said educational reforms would be implemented within this year and that the smooth functioning of law and order will be ensured.\nHome Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said a service constitution for Grama Niladari Officers has been formulated for the first time and that it would be presented for the Cabinet approval shortly.\n\u201cThere had not been a service constitution for GN officers since 1960s. The PM approved the draft prepared by us and it has now been referred to the Trade Unions,\u201d he noted.\n\u201cThe basic salary of a GN officer in Grade III was 13,000 in 2015. By January 2018 we raised it upto Rs.22,960. By 2020, this will further rise to Rs.28,940. The salary of Grade II GN officer, which was Rs 15,000 in 2015, has been increased to Rs 25,618 as at now and it will rise to Rs. 32,290 by 2020. The salary of Grade I GN officer was Rs. 17,000 in 2015 and it is Rs.28,830 now. This will increase to Rs.36,350 in 2020,\u201d said Minister Abeywardena asking any TU member in the audience to disagree if the facts were wrong.\n\u201cWe revived the public sector. Your duty is to implement the Government policies. You may hold different opinions and views, but you are bound to implement the Government policies as per the Establishment Code. You cannot say that you are not here to do what the Government says. Do not weaken the state mechanism and do not sabotage the Government work,\u201d he advised the newly appointed GN officers.\nHome Affairs Deputy Minister J.C. Alawathuwala also spoke. Ministers A.H.M. Fowzie and Rishad Bathiudeen were also present.\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab \u2018Anyone in the Judicial sector to go behind politicians is bad\u2019, President emphasized"}
