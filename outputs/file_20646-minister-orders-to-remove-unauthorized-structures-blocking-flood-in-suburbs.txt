The authorities point out that due to the construction of unauthorized structures along the canalways blocking the water drainage system the risk of flooding is high even with a light rainfall in the city of Colombo and suburbs. As the heavy rains continue, the authorities say the flood risk is likely to elevate in these areas because of hindrance to the water drainage.\nAccordingly, actions will be taken immediately to remove the unauthorized constructions erected without permission and preventing the drainage system.AAA\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Forces on rescue missions"}
