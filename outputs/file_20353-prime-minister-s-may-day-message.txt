Workers are not merely the labourers or farmers like in the 80\u2019s but a whole set of people in different ranks of profession and in different strata of life. Concerns and conversations on individual rights and discharging particular responsibilities to the nation in return are equally important.\n", "nextContent": "Not surprisingly workers\u2019 riots in world\u2019s history have been able to meet many of the demands by the workers. The sacrifices of so many people who fought for the rights and dignities we enjoy today cannot be forgotten.\nYet today we have the challenge of finding other means for our gains. We can end up our fighting for a win- win solution. The workers today have to be radical in the accomplishment of their responsibilities and commitments in order to rewrite a history for the workers\u2019 day.\nI take pleasure in hailing the whole working community on this day and I wish the fulfilment of their own rights while bestowing valour and vigour on them in accelerating the course of the country\u2019s development.\nPrime Minister\n", "externalNewsLink": "\u00ab Vesak at Temple Trees"}
